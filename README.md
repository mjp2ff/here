This is our project for hack.UVA 2014! We're turning your browser into a vehicle, and every website you visit into a place. When you visit a website, you'll automatically join a chat with everybody else using the app visiting that website.

Potential features are:

* Chat for main page of website or sub-pages
* Set usernames
* Option to show other people where you go to if you leave that site (and thus leave the chat)
* Other things!

## Collaborators

* Matt Pearson-Beck
* James Sun
* Richard Knoll
