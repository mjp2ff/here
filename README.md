This is our project for hack.UVA 2014! We're turning your browser into a vehicle, and every website you visit into a place. When you visit a website, you'll automatically join a chat with everybody else using the app visiting that website.

## Installing

See package.json for a list of requirements/dependencies. Additionally, you'll need the 'requests' library in Python to run our testing scripts.

## TODO

* Pick good color pallette to use
* Fix error with text overflowing screen (vertically AND horizontally)
* Find better way to display room title, and username)
* Make features (change name, etc). more obvious
* General improvements

## Potential new features

* Chat for main page of website or sub-pages, depending on crowdedness.
* Set usernames? Or not maybe.
* Option to show other users where you go if you leave the page (and thus leave the chat)
