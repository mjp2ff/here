This is our project for hack.UVA 2014! We're turning your browser into a vehicle, and every website you visit into a place. When you visit a website, you'll automatically join a chat with everybody else using the app visiting that website.

## Installing

See package.json for a list of requirements/dependencies. Additionally, you'll need the 'requests' library in Python to run our testing scripts.

## TODO

* Set up Javascript sample client.
** Polling (time-based)
** Send message (on prompt)
* Front-end stuff!

## Potential new features

* Chat for main page of website or sub-pages, depending on crowdedness.
* Set usernames? Or not maybe.
* Option to show other users where you go if you leave the page (and thus leave the chat)

## Authors
